 anarchism_ideology_noun:0 "Anarchism"
 anarchism_ideology_desc:0 "Anarchist"
 anarchism_sub:0 "Anarchism"
 anarchism_sub_desc:0 "Anarchism is a political philosophy developed by multiple authors, most notably Peter Kropotkin and Mikhail Bakunin. Although initially used to refer to anarcho-communism – which developed in the Black Faction after the First Internationale split – anarchism has come to garner a large number of anarchist sub-ideologies such as anarcho-capitalism, anarcho-pacifism, anarcho-primitivism, and anarcho-feminism, among others.\n\nWhat all anarchist ideologies have in common is the desire to immediately dissolve the state, usually by violent revolution, and replace it with a voluntary form of government relying on the good will of humanity to lead a truly free society into the future."
 totalism_ideology:0 "Totalist"
 totalism_ideology_noun:0 "Totalism"
 totalism_ideology_desc:0 "Socialist"
 totalism_sub:0 "Totalism"
 totalism_sub_desc:0 "Totalitarian socialism, also known as revolutionary nationalism or simply totalism, is argued by its proponents to be a form of non-Marxian socialism devised from the theories of Karl Otto Patel, Ernst Niekisch, and Benito Mussolini, among others. Totalism arguably runs as the polar opposite of traditional Marxian socialism; it intentionally downplays the ideas of class struggle and promotes extreme militarism in contrast to the Marxist view of class struggle against the bourgeoisie and the end of standing armies.\n\nThe end goal of totalism is a state that controls every aspect of life; it rejects the Marxist idea of the state eventually withering away or the anarchist idea of abolishing the state entirely. Totalism sees the role of government and the state to develop a form of totalitarian socialism in a country before using military force to spread socialism to that country’s direct neighbors, usually using nationalist rhetoric to do so."
 socialism_ideology:0 "Socialist"
 socialism_ideology_noun:0 "Socialism"
 socialism_ideology_desc:0 "Socialist"
 socialism_sub:0 "Socialism"
 socialism_sub_desc:0 "Marxian socialism, often referred to as simply socialism, is an economic and political philosophy theorized by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In its most basic sense, socialism is a form of economics where the ownership of the means of production is relegated to the working class and private control of the means of production ceases to exist.\n\nSocialists seek to take control of the bourgeois state via violent revolution and replace it with a dictatorship of the proletariat, which will eventually cede government control of utilities and the means of production to the working class – the proletariat – before eventually dissolving naturally and bringing about a classless and moneyless system known as communism."
 social_democracy_ideology:0 "Social Democratic"
 social_democracy_ideology_noun:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_ideology_desc:0 "Democratic"
 social_democracy_sub:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_sub_desc:0 "Originally referring to a system of early socialist politics, social democracy has evolved to mean a political and economic theory which seeks to humanize the effects of capitalism on society while retaining the capitalist mode of production in a mixed market economy. It is, in a sense, to the furthest left of liberal thought while not embracing socialism.\n\nSocial democracy has been decried by Marxists as being revisionist and by conservatives as socialist. Some tenets of social democracy retain their Marxist philosophy, but by and large it has become independent from socialism. Independent socialist parties may still label themselves as social democratic, but social democracy has forged a unique label for itself."
 liberalism_ideology:0 "Liberal"
 liberalism_ideology_noun:0 "Liberalism"
 liberalism_ideology_desc:0 "Democratic"
 liberalism_sub:0 "Liberalism"
 liberalism_sub_desc:0 "Liberalism is a mainstream form of capitalist and democratic governance born from the theories of English philosopher John Locke and French philosopher Montesquieu, among others. Put into praxis by the Glorious, American, and French Revolutions, liberalism seeks a free-market economy, the consent of the governed, equality before the law, and traditionally the end to monarchism.\n\nLiberal parties began to dominate European governments by the end of the 19th century. Liberal parties tend to support social reforms, but by no means is this a unified opinion among the various liberal parties across the world. Liberal parties traditionally find themselves at odds with conservative and socialist parties, the former for going “too far” and the latter for going “not far enough”."
 conservatism_ideology:0 "Conservative"
 conservatism_ideology_noun:0 "Conservatism"
 conservatism_ideology_desc:0 "Democratic"
 conservatism_sub:0 "Conservatism"
 conservatism_sub_desc:0 "Conservatism is a mainstream form of capitalist and democratic governance. Not necessarily born from the theories of a single philosopher or group of philosophers, conservatism is most explainable as a big tent that can cover ideologies that seek to uphold the traditional status quo against ideologies such as liberalism, social democracy, and the radical trends of today.\n\nConservative parties usually seek to uphold protective trade, the political status quo, traditional family roles, and isolationist policies. They see alternative movements, especially social ones, as suspicious at best and hostile at worst."
 authoritarianism_ideology:0 "Authoritarian"
 authoritarianism_ideology_noun:0 "Authoritarianism"
 authoritarianism_ideology_desc:0 "Reactionary"
 authoritarianism_sub:0 "Authoritarianism"
 authoritarianism_sub_desc:0 "Authoritarianism is a catchall term for any form of government that seeks to increase government control over its citizenry and nation. This can include military dictatorships, absolute monarchies, corporate dictatorships, and presidential dictatorships among others. In contrast to conservatism, authoritarianism tends to not just wish to maintain the status quo but actively reverse its movement and restore tradition.\n\nAuthoritarianism was challenged in the aftermath of the Glorious, American, and French Revolutions, and arguably was on its dying legs by the Revolutions of 1848. Despite this, authoritarian systems independent of the Ancien Régime exist; authoritarian movements can be found across the political spectrum, from paternalistic conservatism to vanguardist socialism."
 ultranationalism_ideology:0 "Ultranationalist"
 ultranationalism_ideology_noun:0 "Ultranationalism"
 ultranationalism_ideology_desc:0 "Reactionary"
 ultranationalism_sub:0 "Ultranationalism"
 ultranationalism_sub_desc:0 "Ultranationalism is a big tent term for various ideologies that put intense focus on militarization of society and extreme nationalism. Ultranationalists seek to expand the nation by any means necessary, usually at the expense of other nations and countries. It has its modern origins in the 1920s German political movement known as "Volkism" but can be traced back to the French Revolution.\n\nUltranationalists are usually diametrically opposed to liberal democracy and Marxism. They may decry both capitalism and socialism and seek to form an economic "third way"; this may be national syndicalism, corporatism, or something completely new. However, ultranationalists can be found from both the left and the right, making ultranationalism not a specific political term but instead a general term for a nation's policy. Nevertheless, most modern ultranationalist movements are totalitarian and far-right in nature."
